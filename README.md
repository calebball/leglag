# LegLag

LegLag is an electronic structure theory program for exploring the unusual properties of one dimensional chemistry.
It was originally described in the paper [_Molecular electronic structure in one-dimensional Coulomb systems_](https://doi.org/10.1039/C6CP06801D), and more background can be found in the following publications:
